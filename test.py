    "Playing ... games has always been thought to be "
    "important to the development of well-balanced and "
    "creative children; however, what part, if any, "
    "they should play in the lives of adults has never "
    "been researched that deeply. I believe that "
    "playing games is every bit as important for adults "
    "as for children. Not only is taking time out to "
    "play games with our children and other adults "
    "valuable to building interpersonal relationships "
    "but is also a wonderful way to release built up "
    "tension.\n"
    "There's nothing my husband enjoys more after a "
    "hard day of work than to come home and play a game "
    "of Chess with someone. This enables him to unwind "
    "from the day's activities and to discuss the highs "
    "and lows of the day in a non-threatening, kick back "
    "environment. One of my most memorable wedding "
    "gifts, a Backgammon set, was received by a close "
    "friend. I asked him why in the world he had given "
    "us such a gift. He replied that he felt that an "
    "important aspect of marriage was for a couple to "
    "never quit playing games together. Over the years, "
    "as I have come to purchase and play, with other "
    "couples & coworkers, many games like: Monopoly, "
    "Chutes & Ladders, Mastermind, Dweebs, Geeks, & "
    "Weirdos, etc. I can reflect on the integral part "
    "they have played in our weekends and our "
    '"shut-off the T.V. and do something more '
    'stimulating" weeks. They have enriched my life and '
    "made it more interesting. Sadly, many adults "
    "forget that games even exist and have put them "
    "away in the cupboards, forgotten until the "
    "grandchildren come over.\n"
    "All too often, adults get so caught up in working "
    "to pay the bills and keeping up with the "
    '"Joneses\'" that they neglect to harness the fun '
    "in life; the fun that can be the reward of "
    "enjoying a relaxing game with another person. It "
    'has been said that "man is that he might have '
    'joy" but all too often we skate through life '
    "without much of it. Playing games allows us to: "
    "relax, learn something new and stimulating, "
    "interact with people on a different more "
    "comfortable level, and to enjoy non-threatening "
    "competition. For these reasons, adults should "
    "place a higher priority on playing games in their "
    "lives"
